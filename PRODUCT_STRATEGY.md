# Product Strategy: Project "Meet Halfway" 📍
**Date:** January 31, 2026
**Status:** MVP V2 Complete
**Target Audience:** Google Leadership / Product Strategy Team

## 1. Executive Summary
"Meet Halfway" is a proposed feature extension for Google Maps that solves the high-friction "coordination tax" of group social planning. By algorithmically identifying fair, high-quality meeting points between multiple users, we transform Google Maps from a **Navigation Tool** into a **Social Coordination Platform**.

## 2. The Problem: "The Text Thread Tax"
Currently, finding a place to meet for two or more people involves a disjointed workflow:
1.  Open messaging app (Whatsapp/iMessage).
2.  Share locations vaguely ("I'm in Mission", "I'm in Marina").
3.  Open Maps individually to guess a midpoint.
4.  Check traffic manually for both parties.
5.  Propose a spot, get rejected, repeat.

**Friction Point:** Users leave the Google Maps ecosystem to coordinate, only returning for the final navigation step. We lose the high-intent "Planning" phase.

## 3. The Solution: Algorithmic Fairness
We automate the negotiation.
*   **Input:** Users simply input their current locations.
*   **Process:** Our engine calculates the optimal meeting point that minimizes *shared pain* (commute time) and maximizes *equality* (variance).
*   **Output:** Curated, high-rating venues (Coffee, Dining, Parks) that are mathematically fair for everyone.

## 4. Why Now? (Market Timing)
*   **Post-Pandemic Reconnection:** Social friction is at an all-time high; users value efficiency in face-to-face meetups.
*   **Gen Z Coordination:** Younger demographics coordinate exclusively in groups. The "N-User" capability of V2 directly addresses this behavior unlike legacy 1-to-1 tools.
*   **Competitive Gap:** Apple Maps has "ETA Sharing" but no "Joint Planning". Third-party tools (like "What's Halfway") use "dumb" geographic midpoints that often fail (oceans, bad neighborhoods) and lack Google's rich venue data.

## 5. Strategic Value for Google
*   **Intent Capture:** Captures the "Where should we go?" intent earlier in the funnel, which is high-value for Ads (sponsored pins at the midway point).
*   **Social Lock-in:** If a group starts planning in Maps, they stay in Maps. It creates network effects for the ecosystem.
*   **Reduction of "Empty Searches":** Reduces the frustration of searching for a place that turns out to be 45 mins away for one person.

## 6. Competitive Landscape

| Feature | Google Maps (Proposed) | iMessage / Apple Maps | 3rd Party ("Midpoint" apps) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | **Fairness Algo** (Travel Time + Variance) | N/A (Manual) | Geographic Midpoint (Dumb) |
| **Data** | **Real-Time Traffic** & Places Data | None in Planning | Limited / Stale Data |
| **Group Size** | **N-Users** (Unlimited) | N/A | Usually 2 Users |
| **Monetization** | High (Sponsored Venues) | None | Low (Banner Ads) |

## 7. Recommendation
Move "Meet Halfway" from MVP to Beta. Integrate directly into the core Maps sidebar as a "Planning" mode toggle.
